## Workflows:

### EYAML:
IT's a workflow created to help encrypting eyaml files for use with puppet (any other users?).

To use it import the work flow and on the first time type eyaml and choose configure. Then type the full path of the public key that must be used for encryption

eyaml <<publick key path>>

Then basicaly type eyaml and -s for encrypting a string
or eyaml -f <path> to encrypt a file
